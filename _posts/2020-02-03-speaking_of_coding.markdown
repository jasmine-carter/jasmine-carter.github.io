This may sound obvious, but something that helps us learn and cement our understanding of code, is being able to talk about it. We get to practice this a bit with the CLI project, but you don't have to wait for a big project to start talking about code!

I'm by no means an expert at writing code, but I wanted to offer my fellow Flatiron students some tips for practicing talking about code. 

# Talk to Yourself
Hear me out, I know that sounds crazy to some of you, but talking to yourself while coding is super helpful! (Maybe it's just me, in which case just skip to my next tip). While I'm writing code, I literally read the code out loud and describe what the specific block does. For me, this helps make connections to what I'm writing, what I _think_ it's supposed to do, and makes me feel a bit more comfortable using proper Ruby terminology. 

Take this method for example:

> def greeting(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}! Welcome to the wonderful world of Ruby programming."
end

Old me would say something like:
"This takes the value of name and shows the user the string "Hi, {whatever the input was}! Welcome to the wonderful world of Ruby programming." 

Not the worst answer, but we can be better by being more specific!

"The method, greeting, takes an argument of name, and puts the string "Hi, #{name}! Welcome to the wonderful world of Ruby programming." The value of name can vary, and the method uses string interpolation to interpret the value of name and place it within the string."

# Rubber Ducky
This isn't a new concept at all, but when I first started working with developers, I heard things like "Thanks for being a good duck". Curious, I looked up rubber duck and software engineering and found [Rubber Duck Debugging.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)

You don't need a duck, or really a physical object. It could even be your best friend, partner, or favorite co-worker. The process is what matters though, and again, it's all about communcation.

Explain your code, line-by-line to whatever form your "duck" takes. Whenever you're forced to explain your code to someone else, you are bound to come to a realization about the solution, or realize a line or method that can be refactored!

Describing what the code is supposed to do, and then observing what it's actually doing, is super helpful. Many Flatiron students may already do this when you have to ask for help with an issue.

Which leads me to my last tip!

# Ask Clear Questions
There comes a time in every student's life where they need to ask for help. It's how we learn! But there are two benefits to asking for help.

1. How you ask the question!


* Asking for help should not just be about you getting the answer. Use clear terms when you need help. 
* For example, instead of saying, "My code won't work", try to be more specific! "My method greeting, isn't putting the string that I expect. I expect X, but I'm getting Y."
* Show your work may be something that you've heard of in math class, but sometimes talking about what you've already tried that doesn't work, can be super helpful!
* By asking more clear questions, you're leveling up your language and ability to talk about code, but sometimes, just typing out the expected vs. actual behavior helps you get to your answer!

 
2. The answer!


* Of course when you ask for help, the answer is important, but I'd argue when it comes to asking for help, it's about the journey, not the destination.

Anywho, I hope these tips come in handy for folks, happy coding!
