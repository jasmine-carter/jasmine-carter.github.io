People may wonder why folks get into software development. I can't speak for people, but I can speak for me!

When I was a kid, I was always considered a "creative type". I drew a lot, I wrote, I crafted, and built. In my mind's eye I could see the end goal, the result of what I was trying to build, and that pointer kept me focused while trying to create it. Eventually my creation would be complete and look (mostly) how I had envisioned it. There was a joy in wondering, "can I make this thing?" and then actually making it happen. 

As I got older, I loved problem solving. Not strictly math problems. I have traumatic memories about a terrible algebra teacher and like to believe that prevented me from becoming a brilliant mathemetician. But logic problems were a joy to me. In middle school, I participated in possibly the nerdiest club ever, and got to compete with other tweens in [Future Problem Solving](https://www.fpspi.org/what-is-fpspi/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAno_uBRC1ARIsAB496IVL3dRoRc2y8r0rj1tPjl73H8VTHGI4dinzp7NnA-JGH3IeNuSa6hIaAkfZEALw_wcB).  We received a **big** problem (think ways to address global warming), and functionally the goal was to come up with as many solutions as possible to that problem. Churning out a bunch of different solutions to a single problem was a ton of fun. There weren't necessarily any *wrong* solutions, but there were some that may have been more efficient to implement than others, and ultimately what was fun was the take away that for any given problem, there are a multitude of ways to approach it.

Eventually I went to school for animation because I was that kid in highschool who had to be pried out of the art room and it just seemed to make sense, and really I didn't know what else I was *good* at. Art seemed like an obvious choice.

Animators and software developers seem to share a lot of attribrutes. 

1. We're lazy
2. We love loops
2. We're creative
3. We solve problems
4. We probably drink a bit too much coffee
5. We're lazy

"So Jasmine", you may be wondering, "when are you going to tell me why you wanted to get into software development?"

Well dear reader, I realized that I liked creating art for myself, not necessarily for other people. Simulatenously I started working at a tech company in the Boston area, and got super interested in how our product worked under the hood. Over time as I got to work with more and more developers, I realized that I really enjoyed reading code, talking about code, and understanding how it worked. Further, that while there are technically good coding practices to follow, there are a million ways to approach a problem while writing code, and the hunt for the best solution, is really appealing to me. 

Technology is constantly changing, evolving, and to be part of that and get to learn new things every day is incredibly appealing to me. 

There's creativity and problem solving involved in software development, and those two things are absolutely my cup of tea. Or coffee.

So here I am!
